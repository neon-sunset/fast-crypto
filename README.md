Fast, lightweight and easy to use cryptographic APIs.

## Todo
- [ ] (in progress) Finalize library API surface
- [ ] (in progress) Implement intrinsics-optimized versions of digest computation methods
- [ ] Implement streaming for hashing and encryption over memory streams and file handles
- [ ] Implement fuzzying and constant-time test suites
- [ ] Add analyzers that cover the API restrictions gaps to ensure the correct usage by end users
- [ ] Add automated benchmark suites to CI pipeline
- [ ] Publish library to nuget.org
